## Introduction to Git

**Git** is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, maintaining the integrity of the codebase with version control.

Key concepts:
- **Repository**: A project directory that contains all your files and their version history.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to the files in the repository.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development to make changes without affecting the main project.
